while creating object when object contains many attributes there are many problem exists:

1. we have to pass many arguments to create object.
2. some parameters might be optional.
3.factory class takes all responsbility of creating object , if the object is heavy then all complexity is
part of factory class.

so in builder pattern we create object step by step and finally return final object with desired value
of attributes.


The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step.
 It's particularly useful when an object requires numerous parameters or configurations during construction,
 and it's not feasible or desirable to have a constructor with an excessively long parameter list.
