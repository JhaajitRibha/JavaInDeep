Observer Design Pattern:

->It is behaviour design pattern.
->In this if the subject changes its state all its dependent object notified the changes.
->One to many relation.


The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a
one-to-many dependency between objects. In this pattern,
when one object (the subject or observable) changes its state,
all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.
This pattern is commonly used to implement distributed event handling systems.
