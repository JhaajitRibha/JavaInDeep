The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch.
because creating a new object may be costly.
This approach saves costly resource and time, especially when object creation is heavy process.

The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to create new objects by
 copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
 Instead of creating new instances through a constructor,
 the prototype pattern involves cloning an existing object and modifying it as needed.
 This pattern is particularly useful when the construction of new objects is more
 complex or resource-intensive, and copying an existing object is more efficient.
